        <h4>Our history</h4>
        <p>
          Christopher and Josefin are our names. We met eachother in the philipines when we both worked in
          the same dog shelter and helped find new homes for stray dogs. Our love for dogs have always
          been there, and that's what brought us together to start this daycare, Pawradise! It was not easy to find 
          the perfect house for our dreams to come true. We wanted a big enough yard for a lot of dogs to run free and
          close enough to big parks to walk. Finally we managed to find this big house in Solna, Stockholm! 
          With help from friends and family we renovated the house to fit a lot of dogs. In October
          2025 we could finally open the doors and welcome new fur friends to our dog daycare!

        <h4>Our vision</h4>
        <p>
        Our vision is to always feel that your dog is in good hands when you need to leave your beloved dog. 
        Whether you are on work or on a holiday! 
        We know that feeling when you are on a vacation and every dog that you see on the streets reminds you of your 
        own dog. That's were Pawradise comes in! Our dog daycare is not your usual one. We 
        want your dog to feel like it's on holiday too!
