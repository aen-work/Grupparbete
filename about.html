        <div class="aboutUs">
          <p>
          We're Christofer and Josefin, the owners of Pawradise.
          Our journey began with a shared dream: to create a space where dogs feel safe, happy, 
          and truly at home. With backgrounds in animal care and small business management 
          (and a house full of rescue pups), we combined our passions to launch this daycare 
          from the ground up. Every tail wag, playful bark, and sleepy cuddle reminds us why we started this 
          adventure. We believe in personalized care, positive reinforcement, and treating every dog like family. 
          Whether it's a high-energy playgroup or a quiet afternoon with a senior pup, we tailor each experience 
          to meet the needs of our fur friends. Our mission is simple: happy dogs, happy humans. 
          And we're so grateful to be part of your dog's story.</a>
          </p>
          <div class="ourVision">
          <h2>Our vision</h2>
          <p>
          Our vision is to always feel that your dog is in good hands when you need to leave your beloved dog. 
          Whether you are on work or on a holiday! 
          We know that feeling when you are on a vacation and every dog that you see on the streets reminds you of your 
          own dog waiting for you at home. That's were Pawradise comes in! Our dog daycare is not your usual one. We 
          want your dog to feel like it's on holiday too!

          <h3>Michaela</h3>
          <p>
          I'm proud to be part of the team here at Pawradise. I've always had a passion for animals, 
          especially dogs, and working in a place where I get to care for them every day is a dream 
          come true. I've been working with dogs for 8 years, and I love getting to know each pup's 
          unique personality. Whether it's playing fetch, giving belly rubs, or making sure 
          everyone is safe and happy, 
          I'm all about creating a fun and loving environment for our furry guests.
          At home, I have a mixed breed dog named Loa and two rats named Hubert and Ron. 
          I truly believe dogs make life better, and I'm excited to help give your pup the 
          best day ever, every day!
          Looking forward to getting to know you and your dog!

          <h3>Jonathan</h3>
          <p>
          I bring my background in positive reinforcement training to the daycare 
          every day. I love helping dogs learn new skills while having fun. From basic manners to enrichment 
          games, I make sure your dog stay mentally and physically stimulated here at Pawradise.

          <h3>Leila</h3>
          <p>
          I'm one of the lucky humans who gets to spend my days 
          hanging out with your awesome dogs at Pawradise. I've always been an animal lover,
          and dogs hold a special place in my heart. Whether it's high-energy zoomies, quiet 
          cuddle time, or just making sure everyone's getting along and having fun. I'm here 
          to make sure your pup feels safe, loved, and totally at home. Before joining the team, 
          I worked at a dog shelter in Nafpaktos region in Greece. Every dog is different, 
          and I love to get to know new personalities. Thanks for trusting us with your fur friend-
          I can't wait to spend more time with them!

          <h3>Jonas</h3>
          <p>
            Dogs have been a part of my life since childhood, and working at a daycare 
            is a dream come true. I'm here to make sure every pup feels loved, safe, and excited to come
            back. When I'm not at work, I'm usually hiking with my own rescue dog, Fido.

          <h3>Moa</h3>
          <p>
          I split my time between caring for dogs and studying animal behavior at university. and 
          The daycare is my favorite classroom. Every pup teaches me something new, whether 
          it's how they communicate, play, or comfort each other. I'm especially passionate about 
          helping nervous or reactive dogs feel safe and confident. When I'm not surrounded by wagging
          tails, you'll find me buried in textbooks or working on research about canine cognition. 
          It's a busy life, but I wouldn't trade it for anything!
